            <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
            <p>
              When it came down to selecting a course project, I was already
              leaning toward Perfect Properties. I have always enjoyed taking
              long drives through unfamiliar neighborhoods to get a glimpse at
              how people make a space uniquely theirs. Once a friend texted me
              and announced that she officially quit her job to focus solely on
              real estate, the decision was final. I saw an opportunity to work
              with her on a project close to both our hearts.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to rename Perfect Properties to Heritage to highlight
              how a single property often has a history and future that goes
              beyond the bounds of a single family.

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
              Investing in real estate is a popular way for individuals to
              achieve financial security. The process is an exciting and
              emotional experience but also complicated. First-time buyers may
              struggle to get started without professional guidance and waste
              time viewing properties out of their scope. Design an app that
              will provide them with the expertise needed to get started with
              ease.
            </p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
              Design a responsive web app that provides first-time property
              buyers with information on properties of interest.
            </p>

            <h3>Design Direction</h3>
            <p>
              The app should feel timeless, clean, bright, and smart. The focus
              is on new buyers looking for investment opportunities.

            <h2>Our Persona</h2>
            <h3>Meet Riley</h3>
            <p>
              Riley is a busy consultant who is frequently on the go. She is a
              pro at multitasking and relies heavily on technology to help her
              manage her tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Riley is looking to invest in properties beyond the city for
              increased financial security for her family. As she is new to real
              estate, she wants an app that helps her find the properties within
              her search scope. She needs to find comprehensive information for
              fast decision-making so as not to waste her time.

          <!-- IDEATE -->
          <div>
            <h2>Ideate</h2>
            <p>
              How can Riley use this app to find investment properties? How can
              Riley use this app with a trusted real estate agent throughout the
              home-buying process? Answering these questions helped me figure
              out which features to include in the first version of this app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, I spoke to friends and family about their experience with
              selling and buying homes. I was able to identify a few key
              features that were important to buyers and agents across the
              board. These interviews helped me determine how people would like
              to navigate through Olive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on my interviews and my exploration of a few popular apps,
              these are a few initial user flows for Riley.

            <h3>Design Decision</h3>
            <p>
              While I think there is a lot of appeal for both versions of
              Heritage, I have decided to continue with the second mood board
              because it more closely aligns with the project brief.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I want to provide my family with financial security. I’ve been
              considering buying property for a while, and am looking for a tool
              that can help me find what I’m looking for, quickly!” -Riley
              (Primary Persona)
            </p>
            <p>
              White is a great way to communicate a calm, simple, and
              professional atmosphere to users. I decided on shades of blue as
              my primary color because it evokes feelings of calm, serenity, and
              trust. Warm accent tones create an atmosphere of stability and
              strength. The balance of cool and warm tones set to a white
              background will support Heritage’s professional and positive
              attitude towards helping everyone find the perfect property.

            <h3>Keep Designing</h3>
            <p>
              As I continue with my UX Immersion course, I want to create more
              screens. I’m interested in interviewing more buyers and real
              estate agents to flush out details.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would begin with more user interviews to understand how people
              feel about each stage of the home buying process. I also want to
              know how agents manage multiple properties and clients. Finally,
              learn more about what features would enhance efficient
              communication between buyers, sellers, and agents.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many competitors to Heritage, but I think through more
              user interviews and usability testing, Heritage can find a niche
              market to cover.

              You know when you look at a word for too long and you're not sure
              it's even a word? Well, that's how I felt multiple times
              throughout this project. I'm learning to permit myself to take a
              break without feeling like I'm falling behind.
            </p>

            <h3>Ask Questions</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike my first UX project, I didn't go through as many stages of
              research. At times I felt a bit lost and unsure of my design
              direction. In these times, I reminded myself to check in with
              others and ask for help thinking through the process.
            </p>

            <h3>Inspiration is Everywhere</h3>
            <p>
              A vast majority of people have some experience buying or selling a
              home or know someone who has. You never know when someone you see
              daily could offer insights into a design decision that feels
              difficult to solve.
