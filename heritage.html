            <h3>Meet Riley</h3>
            <p>
                Riley is a busy consultant who is frequently on the go. She is a pro at multitasking and relies heavily on technology to help her manage her tasks. Riley is looking to invest in properties beyond the city for increased financial security for her family.
            </p>

            <p>
                As she is new to real estate, she wants an app that helps her find the properties within her search scope. She needs to find comprehensive information for fast decision-making so as not to waste her time.
            </p>

            <div>
                <h2>Ideate</h2>
                <p>
                    How can Riley use this app to find investment properties? How can Riley use this app with a trusted real estate agent throughout the home-buying process? Answering these questions helped me figure out which features to include in the first version of
                    this app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, I spoke to friends and family about their experience with selling and buying homes. I was able to identify a few key features that were important to buyers and agents across the board. These interviews helped me determine how people would like to
                    navigate through Olive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on my interviews and my exploration of a few popular apps, these are a few initial user flows for Riley.

                <p>
                    While I think there is a lot of appeal for both versions of Heritage, I have decided to continue with the second mood board because it more closely aligns with the project brief.
                </p>

                    “I want to provide my family with financial security. I’ve been considering buying property for a while, and am looking for a tool that can help me find what I’m looking for, quickly!” -Riley (Primary Persona)
                </p>
                <p>
                    White is a great way to communicate a calm, simple, and professional atmosphere to users. I decided on shades of blue as my primary color because it evokes feelings of calm, serenity, and trust. Warm accent tones create an atmosphere of stability and
                    strength. The balance of cool and warm tones set to a white background will support Heritage’s professional and positive attitude towards helping everyone find the perfect property.

                <p>
                    As I continue with my UX Immersion course, I want to create more screens. I’m interested in interviewing more buyers and real estate agents to flush out details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would begin with more user interviews to understand how people feel about each stage of the home buying process. I also want to know how agents manage multiple properties and clients. Finally, learn more about what features would enhance efficient communication
                    between buyers, sellers, and agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many competitors to Heritage, but I think through more user interviews and usability testing, Heritage can find a niche market to cover.

                    <p>
                        Unlike my first UX project, I didn't go through as many stages of research. At times I felt a bit lost and unsure of my design direction. In these times, I reminded myself to check in with others and ask for help thinking through the process.
