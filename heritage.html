      <!-- WHY -->
      <div>
        <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
        <p>When it came down to selecting a course project, I was already leaning toward Perfect Properties. I have always enjoyed taking long drives through unfamiliar neighborhoods to get a glimpse at how people make a space uniquely theirs. Once a
          friend texted me and announced that she officially quit her job to focus solely on real estate, the decision was final. I saw an opportunity to work with her on a project close to both our hearts.</p>
        <p>I decided to rename Perfect Properties to Heritage to highlight how a single property often has a history and future that goes beyond the bounds of a single family.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- CONTEXT -->
      <div>
        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>Investing in real estate is a popular way for individuals to achieve financial security. The process is an exciting and emotional experience but also complicated. First-time buyers may struggle to get started without professional guidance
          and waste time viewing properties out of their scope. Design an app that will provide them with the expertise needed to get started with ease.</p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>Design a responsive web app that provides first-time property buyers with information on properties of interest.</p>

        <h3>Design Direction</h3>
        <p>The app should feel timeless, clean, bright, and smart. The focus is on new buyers looking for investment opportunities.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- UNDERSTAND -->
      <div>
        <h2>Understanding the Buyer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Primarily for new, small-scale property buyers who are looking to invest for additional income or financial security.</li>
          <li>Provide first-time buyers access to reliable, uncomplicated information about their potential property investments.</li>
          <li>Aid buyers in conducting property searches and making decisions about where to invest.</li>
          <li>Be able to search for properties anywhere; on mobile, tablet, or desktop.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- PERSONA -->
      <div>
        <h2>Our Persona</h2>
        <h3>Meet Riley</h3>
        <p>Riley is a busy consultant who is frequently on the go. She is a pro at multitasking and relies heavily on technology to help her manage her tasks.</p>
        <p>Riley is looking to invest in properties beyond the city for increased financial security for her family. As she is new to real estate, she wants an app that helps her find the properties within her search scope. She needs to find
          comprehensive information for fast decision-making so as not to waste her time.</p>

    <div>
      <!-- IDEATE -->
      <div>
        <h2>Ideate</h2>
        <p>How can Riley use this app to find investment properties? How can Riley use this app with a trusted real estate agent throughout the home-buying process? Answering these questions helped me figure out which features to include in the first
          version of this app.</p>
        <p>Then, I spoke to friends and family about their experience with selling and buying homes. I was able to identify a few key features that were important to buyers and agents across the board. These interviews helped me determine how people
          would like to navigate through Olive.</p>
        <p>Based on my interviews and my exploration of a few popular apps, these are a few initial user flows for Riley.</p>

        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Design Decision</h3>
        <p>While I think there is a lot of appeal for both versions of Heritage, I have decided to continue with the second mood board because it more closely aligns with the project brief.</p>
        <p>“I want to provide my family with financial security. I’ve been considering buying property for a while, and am looking for a tool that can help me find what I’m looking for, quickly!” -Riley (Primary Persona)</p>
        <p>White is a great way to communicate a calm, simple, and professional atmosphere to users. I decided on shades of blue as my primary color because it evokes feelings of calm, serenity, and trust. Warm accent tones create an atmosphere of
          stability and strength. The balance of cool and warm tones set to a white background will support Heritage’s professional and positive attitude towards helping everyone find the perfect property.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You don't need to reinvent the wheel. Familiar designs can improve the user experience.</li>
          <li>When in doubt, keep it simple.</li>
          <li>Feeling stuck? Take a break and come back with fresh eyes.</li>
          <li>Save everything. You never know when an old idea might circle back around!</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- MOVING FORWARD -->
      <div>
        <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
        <h3>Keep Designing</h3>
        <p>As I continue with my UX Immersion course, I want to create more screens. I’m interested in interviewing more buyers and real estate agents to flush out details.</p>
        <p>I would begin with more user interviews to understand how people feel about each stage of the home buying process. I also want to know how agents manage multiple properties and clients. Finally, learn more about what features would
          enhance
          efficient communication between buyers, sellers, and agents.</p>
        <p>There are many competitors to Heritage, but I think through more user interviews and usability testing, Heritage can find a niche market to cover.</p>

      <!-- WALKTHROUGH -->
    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- REFLECTION -->
      <div>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>It's Okay to Take a Break</h3>
        <p>You know when you look at a word for too long and you're not sure it's even a word? Well, that's how I felt multiple times throughout this project. I'm learning to permit myself to take a break without feeling like I'm falling behind.
        </p>

        <h3>Ask Questions</h3>
        <p>Unlike my first UX project, I didn't go through as many stages of research. At times I felt a bit lost and unsure of my design direction. In these times, I reminded myself to check in with others and ask for help thinking through the
          process.</p>

        <h3>Inspiration is Everywhere</h3>
        <p>A vast majority of people have some experience buying or selling a home or know someone who has. You never know when someone you see daily could offer insights into a design decision that feels difficult to solve.</p>
