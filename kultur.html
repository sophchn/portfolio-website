      <!-- SUMMARY -->
      <div>
        <h2>Intro to the World of UX</h2>
        <p>
          The Intro to UX Design course introduced me to important UX terms,
          tools, and techniques. With so many new terms and concepts to learn,
          it seemed fitting that the course project would be a vocabulary
          learning project.
        </p>
        <p>
          While researching how other experience learning new terms, I was able
          to pick up a few tricks while I tackled UX course vocabulary.
        </p>

        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <!-- CRITERIA -->
        <div>
          <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
          <p>
            It can be hard to keep track of new jargon. People need a way to
            categorize, reference, and learn and master new vocabulary and
            concepts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Design a mobile application focused on learning new vocabulary on
            the go. Design should include the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A ​splash screen​, including a logo and tagline</li>
            <li>An ​onboarding process​ or experience</li>
            <li>
              A way to ​sign up and log in​ that allows users to input and save
              their information
            </li>
            <li>An ​admin area​ where users can access their information</li>
            <li>A ​menu​ that lets users navigate the application</li>
            <li>
              A way to​ allow users to upload​ new vocabulary words with
              personal definitions
            </li>
            <li>A way to review vocabulary</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

        <!-- COMPETITORS -->
        <div>
          <h2>Competitive Research</h2>
          <p>
            To give me a better idea of the market, I identified three existing
            vocabulary apps to evaluate. I downloaded each application to my
            phone, next I will highlight the pros and cons of each.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>

      <div>
        <!-- USER RESEARCH -->
        <div>
          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>
            Once I had an idea of the market, it was time to get to know the
            end-user. I interviewed four individuals between 25-35 to learn more
            about their history with vocabulary learning apps.

      <div>
        <!-- PERSONA -->
        <div>
          <h2>Our Persona</h2>
          <p>
            I’d like you to meet Sloan, our user persona. She’s hardworking,
            adventurous, creative, and extremely witty. She loves her job at a
            tech startup, especially the collaborative environment. She is a
            self-proclaimed foodie who is always down to try the newest
            restaurant in town. When she isn’t working or out with friends, she
            can be found knee-deep in planning her next adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            She finds that she learns best when there is variety and even better
            when she feels incentivized. She often is most motivated right
            before a trip or when a friend is also learning the same language.

      <div>
        <!-- NEEDS -->
        <div>
          <h2>User Needs</h2>
          <p>
            Sloan needs a new way to learn that doesn’t feel generic. A place
            that is uniquely her own and will allow her to customize what and
            how she learns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The majority of the apps on the market focus on making users
            proficient, not taking into consideration other motivations to learn
            a new language such as simply wanting to learn food vocabulary,
            slang, or enough to sing along to their favorite Swedish song.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <!-- USER FLOW TASK -->
        <div>
          <h2>User Flow & Task Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            To understand how Sloan might navigate through Kultur, I created a
            user flow for three possible tasks.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Adding own vocabulary</li>
            <li>Collaborative learning</li>
            <li>Setting friendly reminders</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Conducting a task analysis helped me narrow down which screen to
            design for first as I moved into bringing my ideas to life through
            sketch.
          </p>

      <div>
        <!-- WIREFRAME -->
        <div>
          <h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
          <p>
            We now have a persona, a problem, and the primary tasks necessary to
            reach a potential solution. Next, it was time for wireframing and
            building a low-fidelity prototype for testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me some time to get started sketching. The task felt a
            little daunting and, I wasn't sure where or how to start. I
            remembered reading that screens should feel familiar, so I recreated
            standard login screens to help me get drawing.

      <div>
        <!-- TESTING -->
        <div>
          <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
          <p>
            Next, we ran usability tests with our target users. The test
            consisted of four tasks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sign-up/onboarding</li>
            <li>Adding a new word</li>
            <li>Playing a game with a friend</li>
            <li>Setting a new reminder</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Having no previous experience with usability testing, I wasn't sure
            what to expect. I was most looking forward to getting feedback on my
            idea. In my head, it made sense. Now it was time to see if my design
            was as straightforward as I thought it was.

          <h4>Design is an ITERATIVE PROCESS</h4>
          <p>
            There are times when you feel like there is nothing stopping you and
            other times where you feel completely lost in the design process.
          </p>

          <h4>Design is a COLLABORATIVE PROCESS</h4>
          <p>
            Everyone navigates the world differently, reach out to a friend or
            family member, they may have a fresh approach to a task.

            When you’re feeling stuck you may want to keep pushing until you
            figure it out, but instead, take a break, get some air, and come
            back to your design with fresh eyes.
