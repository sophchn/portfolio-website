          <h3>The One-Stop Solution to Health & Wellness</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, people are using various apps to track their mental
            health and wellness. But with so many applications to keep track of,
            people feel overwhelmed and frustrated.
          </p>
          <p>
            People also struggle to get a complete view of their health, making
            it difficult to identify cause and effect patterns.
          </p>

        <h3>The Market</h3>
        <p>
          Over the years, I have tried various health and wellness apps. I was
          familiar with some of the most popular apps, such as Headspace, Calm,
          and BetterHelp. After testing several newer apps, I decided to conduct
          a competitor analysis on two, Wysa and Worry Kit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wysa is an emotionally intelligent AI chatbot co-designed by
          therapists and designers to provide extra support 24/7. ORCHA (health
          app evaluation and advisor organization) rated Wysa 100% on clinical
          assurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worry Kit addresses mental health through a variety of bite-sized
          therapy-informed techniques. Some activities include visualizing
          negative thoughts floating away or stress scratching.
        </p>

      <div>
        <!-- EMPATHIZE -->
        <div>
          <h2>Empathize</h2>
          <p>
            I conducted three interviews with individuals who have varying
            levels of experience with telehealth and treatment plans. Based on
            my interviews, people prefer a mix of self-management and guided
            care. Interviewees shared they felt more motivated to continue
            working on their health when a professional held them accountable.
            Self-motivation only lasts on average 3-6 months.
          </p>
          <p>
            I received 21 survey responses from people. 76% of participants
            stated they were in good health, of which 95% said they trust that
            their doctor makes medical decisions that are in their best
            interest. However, less than 50% were satisfied with coordination
            between departments, explanation of follow-up care, and
            communication between appointments.

          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
          <p>
            People said that to be successful, a health & wellness application
            will have the following qualities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Direct Communication</li>
            <li>Treatment Plans</li>
            <li>Trackers & Resources</li>
            <li>Accessible & Affordable</li>
            <li>Motivational Notifications</li>
            <li>Clear Interface</li>
          </ul>

      <div>
        <!-- DEFINE -->
        <div>
          <h2>Define</h2>
          <p>
            To help me create for everyone and their care team, I developed
            three personas.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Colson: mental health newcomer</li>
            <li>Blake: interested in tracking her headaches</li>
            <li>Amelia: an art therapist</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I began wanting to design for all three personas. I quickly realized
            that the scope of the project would be too much for one person. So,
            I decided to focus on Colson.

          <!-- IDEATE -->
          <div>
            <h2>Ideate</h2>
            <p>
              How can Colson use this app to manage his headaches? How can
              Colson use this app with his therapist on his mental health
              journey? Answering these questions helped me figure out which
              features to include in the first version of this app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, I used a virtual card sort to discover how people would
              group items into categories and expect to navigate through Olive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on the results, I updated the wording, simplified the
              navigation bar, and adjusted some paths in my site map.

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>
              From my research, personas, and sitemap, I had the foundation for
              Olive to begin drafting the interface with sketches.
            </p>
            <p>
              I begin my process with pen and paper. After getting a few ideas
              on paper, I moved on to Balsamiq to rapid prototype top sketches.
              The next step was to translate my wireframes into a high-fidelity
              prototype for usability testing. I brought the design to life with
              colors and icons.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this stage, my designs focused on the features I wanted to test
              during usability testing.

            with real people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was able to recruit 6 participants for my usability testing. After
            usability testing, I ran a preference test for three screens with 20
            respondents. I wrapped this phase of testing with peer feedback from
            my fellow students.

          <p>
            All participants felt overwhelmed while initially viewing their

            <p>
              Preference testing helped me work through some design decisions.
              After usability testing, I wanted to get more feedback on the Home
              page. The page functioned well, but I felt there was room for
              improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked my fellow UX Immersion peers to review a prototype with
              updates from usability and preference testing.

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
              Moving forward, I want to focus more on the Care Team feature. I’m
              interested to see how relationships have changed between patients
              and doctors with the rising popularity of at-home testing, like
              Everlywell.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would begin with user interviews to understand how people feel
              about at-home testing, telehealth, and the future of healthcare. I
              also want to know where professionals stand on the credibility of
              at-home testing. Finally, learn more about what features doctors
              would like to see on Olive.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Olive to succeed, both sides of the platform have to be easy
              and enjoyable to use.

          <h3>No Failures, Just New Discoveries</h3>
          <p>
            This project was my first deep dive into the world of UX. Throughout
            the process, I felt like an imposter. But, I learned to get
            comfortable with making mistakes and finding the silver lining.
          </p>
          <h3>Keep Things Simple & Remain Flexible</h3>
          <p>
            When I am excited about a project, I try to design for every idea
            that pops into my head. I've learned to take a step back and iterate
            my way forward.
          </p>
          <h3>Teamwork Makes The Dream Work</h3>
          <p>
            I love the collaborative environment of working on a team, and this
            solo project only reminded me of that. It is easy to overlook
            elements and get into a rut without feedback and support.
