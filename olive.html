        <h2>Understand</h2>
        <h3>The One-Stop Solution to Health & Wellness</h3>
        <p>Currently, people are using various apps to track their mental health and wellness. But with so many applications to keep track of, people feel overwhelmed and frustrated.</p>
        <p>People also struggle to get a complete view of their health, making it difficult to identify cause and effect patterns.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>The Market</h3>
      <p>Over the years, I have tried various health and wellness apps. I was familiar with some of the most popular apps, such as Headspace, Calm, and BetterHelp. After testing several newer apps, I decided to conduct a competitor analysis on two,
        Wysa and Worry Kit.</p>
      <p>Wysa is an emotionally intelligent AI chatbot co-designed by therapists and designers to provide extra support 24/7. ORCHA (health app evaluation and advisor organization) rated Wysa 100% on clinical assurance.</p>
      <p>Worry Kit addresses mental health through a variety of bite-sized therapy-informed techniques. Some activities include visualizing negative thoughts floating away or stress scratching.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- UNDERSTAND: SWOT -->

        <h3>SWOT Analysis</h3>

        <img src="./img/olive/swot@2.jpg" alt="SWOT Analysis">
      </picture>
    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- EMPATHIZE -->
      <div>
        <h2>Empathize</h2>
        <p>I conducted three interviews with individuals who have varying levels of experience with telehealth and treatment plans. Based on my interviews, people prefer a mix of self-management and guided care. Interviewees shared they felt more
          motivated to continue working on their health when a professional held them accountable. Self-motivation only lasts on average 3-6 months.</p>
        <p>I received 21 survey responses from people. 76% of participants stated they were in good health, of which 95% said they trust that their doctor makes medical decisions that are in their best interest. However, less than 50% were satisfied
          with coordination between departments, explanation of follow-up care, and communication between appointments.</p>

        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p>People said that to be successful, a health & wellness application will have the following qualities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Direct Communication</li>
          <li>Treatment Plans</li>
          <li>Trackers & Resources</li>
          <li>Accessible & Affordable</li>
          <li>Motivational Notifications</li>
          <li>Clear Interface</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- DEFINE -->
      <div>
        <h2>Define</h2>
        <p>To help me create for everyone and their care team, I developed three personas.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Colson: mental health newcomer</li>
          <li>Blake: interested in tracking her headaches</li>
          <li>Amelia: an art therapist</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I began wanting to design for all three personas. I quickly realized that the scope of the project would be too much for one person. So, I decided to focus on Colson.</p>
      </div>

      <div>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- IDEATE -->
      <div>
        <h2>Ideate</h2>
        <p>How can Colson use this app to manage his headaches? How can Colson use this app with his therapist on his mental health journey? Answering these questions helped me figure out which features to include in the first version of this app.
        </p>
        <p>Then, I used a virtual card sort to discover how people would group items into categories and expect to navigate through Olive.</p>
        <p>Based on the results, I updated the wording, simplified the navigation bar, and adjusted some paths in my site map.</p>

      <!-- PROTOTYPE -->
      <div>
        <h2>Prototype</h2>
        <p>From my research, personas, and sitemap, I had the foundation for Olive to begin drafting the interface with sketches.</p>
        <p>I begin my process with pen and paper. After getting a few ideas on paper, I moved on to Balsamiq to rapid prototype top sketches. The next step was to translate my wireframes into a high-fidelity prototype for usability testing. I brought
          the design to life with colors and icons.</p>
        <p>At this stage, my designs focused on the features I wanted to test during usability testing.</p>
      </div>

    <div>
      <!-- TEST -->
      <div>
        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p>With my first working prototype ready to go, it was time to test it with real people.</p>
        <p>I was able to recruit 6 participants for my usability testing. After usability testing, I ran a preference test for three screens with 20 respondents. I wrapped this phase of testing with peer feedback from my fellow students.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <!-- TEST: USABILITY -->
        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>Determine if participants understand what the app is about quickly and easily and the value it provides.</p>
        <h4>Research Questions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Are participants able to successfully begin each task?</li>
          <li>Do participants feel that each feature is relevant to their health and wellness?</li>
          <li>Do participants feel that Olive is enjoyable to use?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Tasks</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Track your headache</li>
          <li>Take an assessment</li>
          <li>Complete a journal entry</li>
          <li>Track your mood</li>
          <li>View insights</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each session ended with exploration & general feedback</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <h4>Highlight Assessments</h4>
        <p>83% of participants struggled to find where to start an assessment. Move assessments to the home page.</p>

        <h4>Simplify Data</h4>
        <p>All participants felt overwhelmed while initially viewing their insights page. Present the data more directly.</p>

        <h4>Emphasize Care Team</h4>
        <p>Many participants stated that they felt they would use more features while working with a healthcare professional.</p>

        <h4>Delightful Experience</h4>
        <p>Overall, all the participants thought that tasks were straightforward. They also noted the interface was chill, calming, and felt modern.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Design Updates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve visibility of supplementary text by changing color</li>
          <li>Consolidate Insights page and Discover</li>
          <li>Bring Assessment option to Home page</li>
          <li>Add additional features to the Journal page</li>
          <li>Organize tracking options (may vary between symptom tracking and mood tracking)</li>
          <li>Consider changing messages to a medical page (doctors, insurance, test results)</li>

          <h3>More Feedback</h3>
          <p>Preference testing helped me work through some design decisions. After usability testing, I wanted to get more feedback on the Home page. The page functioned well, but I felt there was room for improvement.</p>
          <p>I asked my fellow UX Immersion peers to review a prototype with updates from usability and preference testing.</p>

      <!-- FUTURE -->
      <div>
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>Moving forward, I want to focus more on the Care Team feature. I’m interested to see how relationships have changed between patients and doctors with the rising popularity of at-home testing, like Everlywell.</p>
        <p>I would begin with user interviews to understand how people feel about at-home testing, telehealth, and the future of healthcare. I also want to know where professionals stand on the credibility of at-home testing. Finally, learn more
          about what features doctors would like to see on Olive.</p>
        <p>For Olive to succeed, both sides of the platform have to be easy and enjoyable to use.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <h4>No Failures, Just New Discoveries</h4>
        <p>This project was my first deep dive into the world of UX. Throughout the process, I felt like an imposter. But, I learned to get comfortable with making mistakes and finding the silver lining.</p>

        <h4>Keep Things Simple & Remain Flexible</h4>
        <p>When I am excited about a project, I try to design for every idea that pops into my head. I've learned to take a step back and iterate my way forward.</p>

        <h4>Teamwork Makes The Dream Work</h4>
        <p>I love the collaborative environment of working on a team, and this solo project only reminded me of that. It is easy to overlook elements and get into a rut without feedback and support.</p>
