        <!-- CREATIVE JAM -->
        <div>
          <h2>Come On & Slam!</h2>
          <p>
            This spring, Adobe called all UX Bootcamp students and alum to
            compete in a NASA-inspired Creative Jam.
          </p>
          <p>
            After hearing about the event, I immediately knew I wanted fellow
            CareerFoundry student Kei to be my partner in crime. We saw this as
            a fantastic opportunity to add another design project to our
            portfolio, network with other UX designers, and get some much-needed
            constructive feedback from experts.
          </p>
          <p>
            'm so proud of what we accomplished in a week and excited to walk
            you through our process.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <!-- PROJECT BRIEF -->
        <div>
          <h2>The Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Create a tablet app experience to get kids excited about space
            exploration by teaching them about a single or multiple NASA JPL
            missions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The target group is kids between 11 to 13 years old (grades 6 to 8).
            Features may include gaming, gallery, educational content that will
            help them learn more about science, robotics, and space.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <!-- IDEATE -->
        <div>
          <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
          <p>
            Once we figured out the basics; tablet type, a grid, and setting up
            a shared document, we were ready to rumble.
          </p>
          <p>
            We developed the information architecture of Space Jam to help us
            narrow down our ideas. But still wanting to cover everything under
            the Sun, we picked the Solar System as our topic.
          </p>
          <p>Next, it was time to divide and conquer.</p>
        </div>

              media="(max-width:767px)"
            />
            <img src="./img/spacejam/ia@2.jpg" alt="Information Architecture" />

        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <!-- PROCESS -->
        <div>
          <h2>Divide & Conquer</h2>
          <p>
            Kei shined in the research arena, scouring through many articles to
            gather the facts we needed about our Solar System and JPL Missions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on our user personas and mood board, then created the
            planet drawings. Together, we tackled new Adobe XD skills such as
            animation and audio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing that both of us were equally enthusiastic and committed to
            this project brought our vision to life. I still can't believe how
            much we accomplished in one week. And fresh out of our UX Immersion!
          </p>

        <!-- UNDERSTAND -->
        <div>
          <h2>What Do Teens Want?</h2>
          <p>
            Based on the project brief, the tablet app should allow children to
            apply and build on concepts they have already learned and develop an
            understanding of the vast world beyond our planet.
          </p>
          <p>From our research, these were the key takeaways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Care a lot about aesthetic</li>
            <li>Most critical of websites/apps</li>
            <li>Have the ability to skim info</li>
            <li>Prefer not to have to use personal info</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We wanted to design an engaging experience that encouraged children
            to keep asking questions about the world around them.
          </p>

            <p>
              Inspired by the Space Age and the scientific and cultural
              developments from the Space Race, we designed with vintage
              NASA-inspired artwork in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              We finalized our color palette after designing our Solar System.
              With the Solar System at the core of Space Jam, we wanted to
              ensure the palette highlighted the beauty of the Sun and each
              object in its orbit.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the Solar System, we added Astro Buddy to help
              guide teens around Space Jam as they explore NASA JPL Missions.

            <h2>Ready for Takeoff</h2>
            <p>
              As the deadline approached, it was time to finalize our design. We
              hopped on a call and went through each wireframe.
            </p>
            <p>
              We asked ourselves whether the content would be interesting enough
              for a space-enthusiast like Layla (secondary-persona) but not
              overwhelming for a student like Ezra (primary-persona). We felt
              that the interactive Solar System allowed teens to quickly skim
              info while the Discover page gave them a chance to deep-dive into
              specific missions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I invite you to explore our interactive prototype to learn more
              about Space Jam (and a few fun facts about our Solar System)!

              While we didn't place, I had a blast working on Space Jam. I'm so
              proud of what we were able to accomplish in a week. It was a great
              learning experience and, I loved working with a teammate on a UX
              project.

            <h4>Venture Outside Your Comfort Zone</h4>
            <p>
              If in 2019 you told me I would be signing up for a one-week UX
              competition, I would have laughed in your face. But thanks to the
              supportive CareerFoundry community, I decided to push myself
              outside of my comfort zone and give it a go.

            <p>
              Kei and I were not a team simply because we agreed to compete
              together. Kei was my mentor and personal hype man. If I ever felt
              stuck or unsure about my design decisions, she was there to walk
              with me through my thought process.

            <p>
              At the time of the Creative Jam, I doubted if UX was the right
              path for me. I felt that at any moment, a "real" designer would
              call me a fraud. But my gut told me to trust my mentor and know
              that looking back, all the dots would connect themselves.
